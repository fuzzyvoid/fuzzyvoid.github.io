## This is the **Revertices** website. 

It was built from scratch (for some reason) by Lex Feathers.


Some quick tips:

- Edit the HTML files in the /pages directory to change the page contents
- The footer links can be edited in /common/footer.html
- The top of /styles/base.css has a bunch of CSS variables you can modify to change things like the colour, logo size, page width, and so on.
- h2 elements will give you a highlighted title, like on the about page currently
